This website was made as part of the project of the hackathon 'Everyone included' from Telefonica, in Barcelona.
I developed all the parts needed to get the information from the Thinking blocks provided by Telefonica. There are some sensors of humidity, temperature, brightness, etc which connect automatically to the web.
You can find it all in ./Website/tthings.html where there are all the calls to the blocks
