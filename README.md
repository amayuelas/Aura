This website was made as part of the project of the hackathon 'Everyone included' from Telefonica, in Barcelona.

The aim of the hackathon was to develop some applications of the Internet of Things. Our idea was an app to prevent migraine. Thanks to the sensors provided, there are evidences that external conditions such as humidity, brightness, etc have influence on migraine patients. That's why we decided to give show the information receieved on a website.

I developed all the parts needed to get the information from the Thinking Things provided by Telefonica. There are some sensors of humidity, temperature, brightness, etc which connect automatically to the web.
Plus, these blocks also alert of the possibility to suffer migraine in a room by emitting ligth green, yellow or red depending on the room conditions.

You can find it all in ./Website/tthings.html where there are all the calls to the blocks.

The site is no longe online.
